# darktable-colorprofiles
Colections of camera color profiles for darktabe.
Was made with flash as source light and darktable-chart application.
It was mad two profiles, the SONY STD (like the JPGE output) and the colorcheker passport, for the sony a7rIII

To use it import to the darktable using the "styles" tab in the lighttable.

Latter I'll write the procedure used to create the styles.
